# ModiaThermofluid.jl

ModiaThermofluid is planned to become a [Modia](https://github.com/ModiaSim/Modia.jl) model library
for the robust modeling and simulation of complex thermofluid architectures.
It will be based on the  [ThermofluidStream](https://github.com/DLR-SR/ThermofluidStream) Modelica library from DLR-SR.
